# Test task

## General assumptions
- use vite.js as a simple and quick setup for the CSR React project
- the project is built using the latest version of react (18.3.1) and vite (5.4.8)
- typescript is used for type checking
- routing is abandoned for simplicity
- styling is done using css modules, since that  would take more time to style css frameworks for me
- tests are excluded for simplicity
- english is used for the codebase and comments
- the project is built using the LTS node.js (20.10.0)
- icons are not assembled into sprites since there is only one icon(no framework is used for icons either)

## How to run the project
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`


## Several stylistic issues
- distances may vary due to different distances between the elements - hard to decide which to choose
- fetch data is not implemented due to the lack of the API
